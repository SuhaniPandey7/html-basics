<body>
<p>
The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. <br>
The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999. <br>
Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.
